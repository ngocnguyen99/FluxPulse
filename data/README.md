# Data Directory

This folder contains ancillary and example datasets for testing purposes:

- `sample_data.csv`: Example dataset for running the FluxPulse algorithm.
- `Birch_effect_Manual_Label.csv`: Full manually-labeled pulse event datasets across 34 sites, containing SITE_ID, Start of Pulse (SOP), End of Pulse (EOP)
- `Mean_Pulse_decay_stats.csv`:  Decay rate calculated as Mean of Daily NEE across all pulse events in one site, used directly in the FLuxPulse algorithm. Note that this decay rate is calculated differently from the site-specific decay rate obtained to plot Fig 2a, which is the Maximum of Daily NEE.

## Full FLUXNET-formated datasets
Large datasets are not stored in this repository. See [full_FLUXNET_formatted_data/README.md](../full_FLUXNET_formatted_data/README.md) for how to access them.
