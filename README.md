# FluxPulse Version 1.0 (2025)
FluxPulse detects and bias-corrects rain-induced carbon pulses from eddy-covariance flux data across global drylands. <br>

FluxPulse version 1.0 focuses on 34 global dryland sites, whose IGBP vegetation types belonging to Grasslands (GRA), Savannas (SAV), Open Shrublands (OSH), Closed Shrublands (CSH), and Woody Savannas (WSA). <br>
Site locations and general characteristics could be found in https://fluxnet.org/. <be>
